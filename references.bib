  abstract = {Superconducting transition-edge sensors (TES) are extremely sensitive microcalorimeters used as photon detectors with unparalleled energy resolution. They have found application from measuring astronomical spectra through to determining the quantum property of photon-number, \$\textbackslash hat\{n\} \{=\} \textbackslash hat\{a\}\^\{\textbackslash dag\} \textbackslash hat\{a\}\$, for energies from 0.6-2.33eV. However, achieving optimal energy resolution requires considerable data acquisition -- on the order of 1GB/min -- followed by post-processing, which does not allow access to energy information in real time. Here we use a custom hardware processor to process TES pulses while new detections are still being registered, allowing photon-number to be measured in real time as well as reducing data requirements by orders-of-magnitude. We resolve photon number up to n=16 -- achieving up to parts-per-billion discrimination for low photon numbers on the fly -- providing transformational capacity for applications of TES detectors from astronomy through to quantum technology.},
